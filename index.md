I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [**Robotics Institute, University of Technology Sydney (UTS)**, Australia](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/centres/robotics-institute), supervised by [**Prof. Shoudong Huang**](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shoudong.Huang) and [**A/Prof. Liang Zhao**](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/liang-zhao). My research  primarily focuses on medical robotics, computer assisted intervention, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), particularly for orthopaedic surgery.
